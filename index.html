  <h1>Hi, I'm Allison, and I'm a maker*.</h1>
  <h3>* including but not limited to: coder, designer, musician, storyteller.</h3>

    <p>
    I’m a Dartmouth College student studying computer science and <br>
    human-centered design because I’m excited about building a better <br>
    future with technology. When I’m not geeking out about that, I’m <br>
    probably geeking out about music and theatre.
